1. Caching your GitHub password in Git

Turn on the credential helper so that Git will save your password in memory for some time. 
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=36000'
    # Set the cache to timeout after 10 hours (setting is in seconds)



2. Unit testing. 
  PyTest and CTest must be installed
